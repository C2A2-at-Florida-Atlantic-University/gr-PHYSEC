Securing wireless communication against eavesdropping is critical, particularly in dynamic and decentralized environments. This work introduces a novel AI-assisted method for generating cryptographic keys based on channel fingerprinting using physical layer features. Unlike traditional key generation that relies on pre-shared secrets or computational complexity, our approach derives symmetric keys from the wireless channel’s inherent randomness.

To implement this, we embed a trained neural network within GNU Radio to extract channel features between trusted parties (Alice and Bob) during probe exchanges. These features are quantized into binary keys, reconciled via Reed-Solomon encoding, and further secured with SHA-256 hashing. The generated keys are then directly used to encrypt data, which is transmitted using GNU Radio’s existing “file transfer using packet and BPSK” framework.

Real-world experiments on the POWDER testbed using SDRs validate the approach under indoor and outdoor deployments. Results demonstrate low key disagreement rates and strong randomness, as verified by the NIST test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators for cryptographic applications, while maintaining reliable encrypted communication over standard BPSK links. This integration showcases how GNU Radio can support real-time AI-driven security solutions, pushing the boundaries of software-defined secure communication.
